# Getting Started with Create React App

A brief description of Portfolio project.


## Project Overview
"Rehan Itelier" is a dynamic and modern portfolio website built using React, designed to showcase the professional accomplishments, skills, and creative work of Rehan Itelier. The primary purpose of this website is to provide an engaging platform for Rehan to present his portfolio to potential employers, clients, and the broader online community.

## Key Features:
Portfolio Showcase: The website features a visually appealing portfolio section where Rehan can display his projects, artwork, and creative endeavors. Each portfolio item includes detailed information, images, and links to related projects or external sources.

## About Me:

 Visitors can learn more about Rehan through the "About Me" section, which includes a brief biography, professional background, and a personal touch to establish a connection with the audience.

## Resume Download:

 Rehan's resume is easily accessible for download, allowing interested parties to review his qualifications and experience.

## Contact Form: 

A contact form is provided to enable visitors to reach out to Rehan directly. It offers a convenient way for potential collaborators, employers, or clients to initiate communication.

## Responsive Design: 

The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Smooth Navigation: 

The website features a user-friendly navigation menu that allows visitors to explore different sections of the portfolio effortlessly.

## Customization: 

The website's design and content can be easily customized and expanded to accommodate future projects and updates.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
